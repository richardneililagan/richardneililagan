# 👋 Hey there, I'm Richard!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m a Senior Software Engineer who loves building cool stuff --- mostly with TypeScript and CSS, but I’ll happily dabble in Rust, Python, or Ruby when the mood strikes.

## 🚀 What I do

- **Current:** Senior Software Engineer (writing code, designing subsystems, shipping features, probably (read: _definitely_) drinking too much coffee).
- **Previous lives:** Prototyping Architect & Solutions Architect for AWS. I've also done some rounds of both startup and corporate software engineering.

## 💻 Tech I like

- **TypeScript** & **CSS** --- I normally reach for these.
- **Rust**
- **Python**
- **Ruby**
