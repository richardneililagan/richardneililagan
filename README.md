# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Richard

Here be dragons.

## The skinny

- I wish I was skinny(-er).
- I'm always trying to learn something new. (Currently I'm trying to round out my Postgres knowhow.)
- I'm a software engineer at heart, but professionally I've been a prototyping / solutions architect as well.
- My weapons of choice are most often Typescript and CSS.
  - but I reach for Rust / Python / Ruby every so often too.
- Reach out to me at [@richardneililagan.com][bluesky] or [@techlifemusic@hachyderm.io][mastodon].
- I write stuff from time to time at [richardneililagan.com][website].

If you want to talk shop, swap ideas, or just say hi, feel free to reach out! Iâ€™m always open to new projects, collaborations, or just a good meme.
